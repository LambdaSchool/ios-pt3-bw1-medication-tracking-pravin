## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
    - organize project
    - create storyboard
    - create model, view controllers, view cell, and controller
    
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
        - drag navigation controller with table view
        - make navigation controller as initial controller
        - drag view controller
        - add bar button to table view 
        - add bar button to view controller 
        - create segue from bar button to view controller
        - set title on table view
        - create label(s) 
        - create text field
        - create text view
        - write the code model, controller
        - write the code for the view controllers 
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
